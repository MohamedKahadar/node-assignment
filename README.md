# Target Calculation Project

## Description
This project contains a function that calculates the total target across a specified date range, accounting for excluded days (e.g., Fridays). The function also computes the number of valid working days and distributes the total target across those days.

## Instructions
To run the code, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/target-calculation.git
   

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   bash
   cd target-calculation
   

3. Open a JavaScript environment or use Node.js to execute the code. For example:
   bash
   node index.js
   

## Function Explanation
The main function `calculateTotalTarget` takes the following parameters:
- `startDate` (string): The start date of the target period (format: YYYY-MM-DD).
- `endDate` (string): The end date of the target period (format: YYYY-MM-DD).
- `totalTarget` (number): The overall target to be distributed across the valid working days.
- `excludeDay` (number, optional): The day of the week to exclude (default is 5, which corresponds to Friday).

### How It Works
1. **Date Initialization**: The function converts the input dates into `Date` objects.
2. **Monthly Iteration**: It iterates through each month within the date range.
3. **Days Calculation**: For each month, it calculates:
   - Total days within that month that fall between the start and end dates.
   - Number of excluded days (Fridays, by default).
   - Valid working days (total days minus excluded days).
4. **Target Distribution**: It distributes the total target across the valid working days of the entire period.
5. **Results Compilation**: It compiles the results into an object that contains:
   - Total days in each month.
   - Valid working days excluding the specified day.
   - Monthly targets for each month.
   - Overall target value.

## Example of Usage
javascript
const result = calculateTotalTarget('2024-01-01', '2024-03-31', 5220);
console.log(result);


## Assumptions and Limitations
- The function assumes that the date format provided is correct (YYYY-MM-DD).
- The function only excludes one specific day of the week (default is Friday) and does not account for holidays or other non-working days.
- The function may yield unexpected results if the start date is later than the end date; input validation is not included.
- The total target is equally distributed among valid working days without considering varying workloads.
